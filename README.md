## **Proposal: Blockchain Integration in Card Rush**

### **Key Blockchain Features**
1. **NFT-Based Card Ownership**
   - Each card is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the **Solana blockchain**.
   - Players can own, trade, and sell cards securely within the game or on external marketplaces.

2. **Decentralized Marketplace**
   - The in-game Card Shop leverages Sovryn to facilitate secure transactions using cryptocurrencies (e.g., SOL).
   - Players can purchase exclusive card packs, participate in auctions, and trade cards with other players.

3. **Player Rewards**
   - Players earn blockchain-based rewards by winning battles or participating in special events, encouraging competitive gameplay.
   - Rewards can include rare NFT cards, SOL tokens, or exclusive items.

4. **Immutable Leaderboards**
   - Multiplayer battle rankings are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

### **Blockchain Use Cases in Card Rush**
- **Enhanced Player Ownership**: Cards are tied to the blockchain, offering true ownership beyond the game itself.
- **Secure Transactions**: Solana's fast and low-cost transactions make card trading and purchases seamless and efficient.
- **Interoperability**: Future plans could allow cards to be used across different blockchain-based games.

By integrating **Sovryn** and **Solana**, **Card Rush** provides players with a secure, scalable, and rewarding gaming experience while showcasing the power of blockchain technology in enhancing traditional game mechanics.
